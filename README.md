This app is the beginning idea of a project that I company I currently work for can use because what we currently have works but it is lacking some basic functions.


App homepage should load asking "Did you restart your device?" There should be a light hearted joke if they choose no. 

Submitting tickets on the system should be straight forward and easy for the user. A simple of entry, how they would like to be contacted and then the issue. (future idea - The tech who handles it can be assigned manually or by random generator.)

Submitting a ticket for a new user should be pretty straight forward as well. This way when entering the information into Active Directory/Azure Directory/AWS would be seamless. 

The list pages will show current tickets in progress. The Employee list will show current employee (future - devices assigned to them).
